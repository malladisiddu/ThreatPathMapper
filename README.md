# ThreatPathMapper: Advanced Attack Path Visualization & Analysis

> This project is based on the original [RAF-AG research by CyberLab](https://github.com/cyb3rlab/RAF-AG)  
> Enhanced with advanced visualization and multi-format attack chain analysis capabilities

ThreatPathMapper is an AI-powered cybersecurity framework that automatically processes threat intelligence reports and generates structured attack paths mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Rather than requiring manual analysis, ThreatPathMapper uses graph-based knowledge matching to transform unstructured threat intelligence content into actionable attack intelligence with professional visualization capabilities.

## Key Features

### **Core Capabilities:**
1. **Automated Attack Path Generation**: Converts threat intelligence reports into sequential attack chains
2. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping**: Automatically identifies and maps techniques to the MITRE framework
3. **Graph-based Analysis**: Uses knowledge graphs for semantic understanding of attack narratives
4. **Multi-format Visualization**: Generates attack chains in multiple formats for different audiences

### ThreatPathMapper Enhanced Features:
- **Kill Chain Structure**: Organizes techniques by MITRE ATT&CK tactic phases
- **Attack Path Analysis**: Shows primary and alternative attack progressions
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Simple flow, narrative story, tabular summary, and detailed analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides probability scores for each technique identification
- **Interactive Analysis**: Comprehensive technique descriptions with implementation methods and tools

### ThreatPathMapper Enhancements Over Original RAF-AG:
- **4 Visualization Formats**: Executive summaries, technical analysis, narratives, and structured tables
- **Enhanced MITRE Mapping**: Expanded technique-to-tactic mappings with 200+ techniques
- **Kill Chain Analysis**: Professional-grade attack progression visualization
- **Multi-audience Output**: Formats tailored for executives, analysts, and technical teams
- **Improved Documentation**: Comprehensive setup guides and troubleshooting
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV, JSON, and console output options
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management and Docker improvements

The figure below shows an overview of the underlying RAF-AG architecture. In ThreatPathMapper, text data from MITRE ATT&CK (e.g., procedure examples) are transformed into graphs (the blue path). The graphs will establish the framework's knowledge base. ThreatPathMapper takes CTI reports as its main input. These CTI reports will also be transformed into graphs (the red path).
To analyze a specific report and generate its attack path (the black path), we conduct a graph alignment between the report graph and the framework's internal graphs. After that, the graph alignment results will be decoded into the attack paths.

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture

ThreatPathMapper uses a graph-based knowledge matching approach that differs from traditional keyword-based tools:

```
CTI Reports → NLP Processing → Graph Alignment → Attack Path Generation → Multi-format Visualization
```

**Key Components:**
- **Knowledge Base**: MITRE ATT&CK framework converted to searchable knowledge graphs
- **NLP Engine**: SpaCy-based parsing for semantic understanding
- **Graph Alignment**: Matches report content against MITRE technique patterns
- **Path Generation**: Reconstructs chronological attack sequences
- **Visualization Layer**: Multiple output formats for different audiences

**Technology Stack:**
- **NLP**: SpaCy, TensorFlow Hub embeddings
- **Graph Processing**: NetworkX for knowledge graph operations
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow for semantic similarity
- **Visualization**: Custom Python formatting and tabulation

### How ThreatPathMapper Works

1. **Input**: Technical blogs, threat reports, incident analyses
2. **Processing**: Converts text into structured knowledge graphs
3. **Matching**: Finds semantic similarities with MITRE ATT&CK patterns
4. **Sequencing**: Reconstructs attack timeline from narrative flow
5. **Output**: Structured kill chains with confidence scores

```

## Enhanced Attack Chain Analysis

ThreatPathMapper features a comprehensive **Enhanced Attack Chain Analysis System** that generates multiple visualization formats for different audiences and use cases.

### Kill Chain Visualization

The enhanced system organizes attack techniques by **MITRE ATT&CK tactic phases**, similar to professional threat intelligence reports:

```
TA0001 - INITIAL ACCESS
  1. T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment (Confidence: 0.911)
  2. T1190 - Exploit Public-Facing Application (Confidence: 0.876)

TA0002 - EXECUTION  
  1. T1059.001 - PowerShell (Confidence: 1.000)
  2. T1059.003 - Windows Command Shell (Confidence: 0.944)
```

### Multiple Output Formats

The system automatically generates **4 different visualization formats**:

#### **1. Simple Attack Flow** (Executive Summary)
```
Resource Development → Initial Access → Execution → Persistence → 
Privilege Escalation → Defense Evasion → Credential Access → Discovery → 
Lateral Movement → Collection → Command and Control → Exfiltration
```

#### **2. Attack Story** (Narrative Format)
```
Complete Attack Narrative:
1. Attackers develop malware for the attack
2. Exploit public-facing application to gain access  
3. Execute PowerShell commands
4. Establish persistence via remote services
5. Escalate privileges using accessibility features
...
```

#### **3. Attack Summary Table** (Clean Tabular)
```
Phase                Technique    Action                                    Confidence
Resource Development T1588.001    Develop malware for the attack           1.000     
Initial Access       T1190        Exploit public-facing application        0.994     
Execution            T1059.001    Execute PowerShell commands              1.000     
```

#!/bin/bash
# Enterprise threat intelligence processing

# Prepare multiple reports
cp apt29_report.html data/campaign/input/
cp lazarus_analysis.pdf data/campaign/input/  
cp carbanak_incident.txt data/campaign/input/

# Run batch analysis
python3 main.py --campaign_from_0=True

# Generate comprehensive reporting
mkdir -p threat_intelligence_reports
for result_file in data/campaign/decoding_result/*.json; do
    campaign_name=$(basename "$result_file" .json)
    echo "Processing $campaign_name attack chain..."
    
    # Generate all formats
    python generate_tabular_data.py "$result_file" \
        --save-csv --save-json \
        --output-dir threat_intelligence_reports/$campaign_name
done

echo "Complete threat intelligence analysis ready!"
```

### Example 3: Integration with Security Operations

**Automated CTI Processing Pipeline:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# SOC Integration Script

CTI_INPUT_DIR="data/campaign/input"
REPORTS_DIR="security_reports"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

echo "Starting daily CTI processing - $DATE"

# 1. Process new threat intelligence
if [ "$(ls -A $CTI_INPUT_DIR)" ]; then
    echo "Found new CTI reports, processing..."
    python3 main.py --campaign_from_0=True
    
    # 2. Generate security reports
    mkdir -p $REPORTS_DIR/$DATE
    
    for result_file in data/campaign/decoding_result/*.json; do
        campaign_name=$(basename "$result_file" .json)
        
        # Executive summary (simple flow)
        python generate_tabular_data.py "$result_file" \
            --save-csv --output-dir $REPORTS_DIR/$DATE/executive
        
        # Technical analysis (detailed)
        python generate_tabular_data.py "$result_file" \
            --save-json --output-dir $REPORTS_DIR/$DATE/technical
            
        echo "Generated reports for: $campaign_name"
    done
    
    echo "Daily CTI processing complete!"
    echo "Reports available in: $REPORTS_DIR/$DATE/"
else
    echo "No new CTI reports found"
fi
```

### Example 4: Academic Research Usage

**Research Dataset Analysis:**
```bash
# Process research dataset
python3 main.py --campaign_from_0=True

# Generate research-friendly outputs
for result_file in data/campaign/decoding_result/*.json; do
    campaign_name=$(basename "$result_file" .json)
    
    # Research data export
    python generate_tabular_data.py "$result_file" \
        --save-csv --save-json \
        --output-dir research_data/$campaign_name
        
    echo "Research data generated for: $campaign_name"
done

# Aggregate results for statistical analysis
echo "Campaign,Primary_Tactic,Technique_Count,Avg_Confidence" > research_summary.csv
# Additional processing scripts can analyze the JSON outputs
```

## Performance and Troubleshooting

### Performance Optimization

**Memory Management:**
```bash
# For large CTI reports, increase Docker memory
docker-compose run --rm -m 8g threatpathmapper python3 main.py

# Disable multiprocessing for memory-constrained environments
python3 main.py --multiprocessing=False

# Process files individually for very large datasets
python3 main.py --campaign_from_0=True --single_file=target_report.html
```

**Processing Large HTML Files:**
```bash
# Pre-process HTML to extract main content
# Remove embedded files, scripts, and styling
# Keep only threat intelligence narrative

# Monitor processing resources
docker stats  # Monitor Docker resource usage
htop         # Monitor system resources
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **1. Process Killed / Memory Issues**
```bash
# Issue: Process terminates with "Killed" message
# Solution: Increase available memory

# Docker approach:
docker-compose down
# Edit docker-compose.yml to add:
# deploy:
#   resources:
#     limits:
#       memory: 8G
docker-compose up --build

# Local approach:
# Close other applications
# Use virtual environment instead of Docker
source venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py
```

#### **2. Dependency Issues**
```bash
# Virtual environment setup
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install tabulate spacy tensorflow-hub
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
```

#### **3. Docker Build Issues**
```bash
# Clear Docker cache and rebuild
docker system prune -f
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Use local environment if Docker issues persist
source venv/bin/activate
python generate_tabular_data.py "data/campaign/decoding_result/Your_Campaign.json"
```

#### **4. Empty or Invalid Results**
```bash
# Verify input file format
ls -la data/campaign/input/

# Check processing logs for errors
tail -f processing.log

# Test with smaller sample file first
echo "Simple APT attack using spearphishing" > data/campaign/input/test.txt
python3 main.py
```

### Debugging Tips

**Monitor Processing:**
```bash
# Watch processing progress
tail -f data/campaign/output/*.log

# Check intermediate results
ls -la data/campaign/procedure_alignment/
ls -la data/campaign/tech_alignment/
```

**Validate Results:**
```bash
# Check if analysis completed
ls -la data/campaign/decoding_result/

# Verify JSON structure
jq '.' data/campaign/decoding_result/your_campaign.json | head -20
```
